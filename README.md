# Flashcard-Program

First the program displays the term on the front of the car for 1 second, then shows the back of the card, which has the description or translation of the word. Users use the check button to indicate that they have memorized the term and remove it from the csv file, which stores words and definitions, or click the X button to see the word again later. Currently the words in the program are the 100 most common French words and their English translations. 

This project is day 31 of the 100 days to python mastery challenge on Udemy.com.
